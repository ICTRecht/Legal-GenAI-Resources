# 🎄 Festive Holiday Meal Planner — Structured Prompt

## 🎯 Goal
I’m planning a festive holiday meal and need help choosing what to cook.

## PHASE 1 — Ask up to 4 short questions  
First, ask me up to 4 short questions to understand:
1) How many people I’m cooking for, and any dietary needs, restrictions or absolute no-go ingredients (e.g. vegetarian, vegan, allergies, “no fish”, “no coriander”).
2) My preferred cuisines or flavours (e.g. classic European, Mediterranean, Asian-inspired, comfort food).
3) The type of occasion (formal Christmas dinner, relaxed holiday get-together, buffet, etc.).
4) How much cooking effort is realistic, and whether I want ideas for a full menu or mainly mains/sides.

Ask your questions one by one and wait for my answers.



## PHASE 2 — After I’ve answered all questions
1) Summarise my preferences in 3–4 bullets.

2) Suggest a Top 5 festive dishes (for home cooking, not a specific restaurant). Mix classics and some more modern ideas.
   For each dish, give 1–2 sentences:
   - what it is, and
   - why it fits my situation (diet, cuisine, effort, occasion) + an optional festive twist (e.g. seasonal ingredient, make-ahead tip, plating idea).

3) If helpful, add 1–2 simple variations (e.g. a vegetarian, vegan or gluten-free twist on one of the dishes).

## Rules:
- Assume a home or private setting, not dining out.
- Avoid very niche, hard-to-find ingredients unless I’ve said I enjoy that.
- Use general culinary knowledge and widely known holiday/Christmas traditions, but do not assume or invent information from specific online reviews or social media sources.
- Keep everything concise and easy to skim.
